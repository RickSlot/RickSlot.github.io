## Project Overview

This project is a static photo portfolio website. It uses a shell script to generate a JSON file with photo metadata and thumbnails, which are then displayed on the portfolio page.

## Key Technologies

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Build Script:** Bash (`build_portfolio.sh`)
- **Dependencies:**
    - `exiftool`: For extracting EXIF metadata from photos.
    - `sips`: For creating thumbnails (macOS specific).
    - `jq`: For parsing JSON in the build script.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main landing page.
- `portfolio.html`: The photo gallery page. It fetches photo data from `photos.json` and displays the images in a lightbox with EXIF data.
- `photos.json`: A JSON file containing an array of photo objects. Each object includes the filename and EXIF data (aperture, shutter speed, ISO, focal length). This file is generated by the `build_portfolio.sh` script.
- `build_portfolio.sh`: A shell script that:
    1. Generates thumbnails for all `.jpg` files in the `photos/` directory using `sips`.
    2. Extracts EXIF data from each photo using `exiftool`.
    3. Creates the `photos.json` file with the extracted metadata.
- `photos/`: Directory for the original photo files.
- `photos/thumbnails/`: Directory where the generated thumbnails are stored.
